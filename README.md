Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Konrad Synowiec


I've been into Machine Learning/Deep learning since my project about market predictions. 
Nowadays, my goal is to enhance my Computer Vision knowledge and dive deeper into CNN and Deep Learning.

I'm looking for a Python backend job related to ML/DL, CV, or data analysis.
